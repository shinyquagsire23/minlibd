This directory will contain examples how the executable can be sent to
the target processor. 

The default format that gcc produces is elf.
When using gold linker, elf is the only possible format. 

Elf is quite complex but it is easy to parse with structures defined
in elf.h (look 'man elf'). So there should be no need for other formats
like the old s-file. If another format is needed there usually is some
converter program for it.
