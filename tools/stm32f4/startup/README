This directory contains the minimum set of files that are needed 
to start the processor. These have been collected from ST standard
peripheral library for stm32F4 and the original license applies here.

What is needed here depends totally on the processor.
Anything that has to be done before calling main is put here. 
Typical things are setting processor mode and initializing clock
system, memory controller and interrupt controller.

This set is tested only with stm32f407 and is a little bit old.
The current library from ST may contain a different version.

This directory contains:


startup.S   :  startup code and vector table. 

The startup code is called directly from reset. In this processor,
any reset operation calls the reset vector that is the first in the 
vector table.
I have only added attribute thumb_func at line 66. Otherwise the thumb
bit may not be correct in the address of reset vector.

The code copies data from rom to the data section and zeroes the
bss section. Then it calls the clock setup routine and after that
jumps to main.

Note that all assembler files should have suffix .S in this
toolset, because .s is for intermediate files that are removed with
make clean.


system_stm32f4xx.c : system initialization

This file has functions to set the system oscillator and external
memory controller. It is assumed that the system has an external
25 Mhz oscillator. Then the system frequency is set to 168 Mhz.

I have modified the file such a way that if the oscillator is not 
found, the system starts with internal oscillator at 107 Mhz.
The memory initialization functions are not used here.


The headers are required by system_stm32f4xx.c. I am not sure if they
all are really needed but included anyway.
