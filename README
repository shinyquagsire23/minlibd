This collection has libraries and tools to compile D language programs for
embedded or "bare metal" systems with the gdc compiler. The main focus is
STM32 controllers but the library and build tools are easy to port to any
processor.

The original D runtime library uses libraries from the operating system.
It can not be used in embedded systems when there is no operating
system. 

CURRENT STATE:
This version is compatible with gdc head from august 2016 and matching
gcc 7 version.



This package is in bitbucket.org/timosi/minlibd.
Check the wiki all README files for more info. 

To use this, you need a gdc compiler installed.
Gdc is a D language compiler that runs with the gnu gcc compiler.
More about gdc can be found in gdcproject.org.
More about the D language is in dlang.org.
More about gcc is in gcc.gnu.org.
