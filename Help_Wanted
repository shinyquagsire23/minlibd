Any suggestions and commits are welcome. 
Here are some areas that might need development:

- Support for other processors and systems
This project started because there was need for a toolset for stm32 
processors. Although arm is one of the most used processors and stm32 is one
of the most used arm controllers, there are several other processors.
Support for any of them is welcome. Also support for platforms that have
some operating system are welcome.

- Library versions
The first version of this library goes in the middle way: a minimum set of
files is included with minimum changes. It could be useful to have at
least two additional versions: a very minimum library for small
systems where all extra functions are stripped from files.
Then a maximum version where all possible files are included and also
anything from phobos that can be compiled

- Linking issues
There are still several issues in linking. Some of them are found in
README.tls

- Windows support
To make a D cross compiler that can be used in Windows. Either turning
the native Windows gdc to cross compiler or adding D support to any
other Windows toolchain.

- Startup files and standard libraries.
Support of peripherals in controllers or other hardware. Also any
simple libraries for math, communication etc. The keyword is: simple.
For example: do we need support for odd parity in uart just because our
hardware can do it? Anyone who really needs it, can extend the standard
class and override the functions. That is the idea of oo programming, I think.
